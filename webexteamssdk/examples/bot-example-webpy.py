"""A simple bot script.

This sample script leverages web.py (see http://webpy.org/).  By default the
web server will be reachable at port 8080 - append a different port when
launching the script if desired.  ngrok can be used to tunnel traffic back to
your server if you don't wish to expose your machine publicly to the Internet.

You must create a Webex Teams webhook that points to the URL where this script
is hosted.  You can do this via the WebexTeamsAPI.webhooks.create() method.

Additional Webex Teams webhook details can be found here:
https://developer.webex.com/webhooks-explained.html

A bot must be created and pointed to this server in the My Apps section of
https://developer.webex.com.  The bot's Access Token should be added as a
'WEBEX_TEAMS_ACCESS_TOKEN' environment variable on the web server hosting this
script.

NOTE:  While this script is written to support Python versions 2 and 3, as of
the time of this writing web.py (v0.38) only supports Python 2.
Therefore this script only supports Python 2.
