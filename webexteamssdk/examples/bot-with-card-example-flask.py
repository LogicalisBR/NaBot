"""A simple bot script, built on Flask, that demonstrates posting a
card, and handling the events generated when a user hits the Submit button.

A bot must be created and pointed to this server in the My Apps section of
https://developer.webex.com.  The bot's Access Token should be added as a
"WEBEX_TEAMS_ACCESS_TOKEN" environment variable on the web server hosting this
script.

This script must expose a public IP address in order to receive notifications
about Webex events.  ngrok (https://ngrok.com/) can be used to tunnel traffic
back to your server if your machine sits behind a firewall.

The following environment variables are needed for this to run

* WEBEX_TEAMS_ACCESS_TOKEN -- Access token for a Webex bot
* WEBHOOK_URL -- URL for Webex Webhooks (ie: https://2fXX9c.ngrok.io)
* PORT - Port for Webhook URL (ie: the port param passed to ngrok)

This sample script leverages the Flask web service micro-framework
(see http://flask.pocoo.org/).  By default the web server will be reachable at
port 5000 you can change this default if desired (see `flask_app.run(...)`).
In our app we read the port from the PORT environment variable.

Upon startup this app create webhooks so that our bot is notified when users
send it messages or interact with any cards that have been posted.   In
response to any messages it will post a simple form filling card.  In response
to a user submitting a form, the details of that response will be posted in
the space.

This script should support Python versions 3.6+ only.
