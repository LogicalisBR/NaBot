"""Sample script to read local ngrok info and create a corresponding webhook.

Sample script that reads ngrok info from the local ngrok client api and creates
a Webex Teams Webhook pointint to the ngrok tunnel's public HTTP URL.

Typically ngrok is called run with the following syntax to redirect an
Internet accesible ngrok url to localhost port 8080:

    $ ngrok http 8080

To use script simply launch ngrok, and then launch this script.  After ngrok is
killed, run this script a second time to remove webhook from Webex Teams.
