"""A simple bot script, built on Flask.

This sample script leverages the Flask web service micro-framework
(see http://flask.pocoo.org/).  By default the web server will be reachable at
port 5000 you can change this default if desired (see `flask_app.run(...)`).

ngrok (https://ngrok.com/) can be used to tunnel traffic back to your server
if your machine sits behind a firewall.

You must create a Webex Teams webhook that points to the URL where this script
is hosted.  You can do this via the WebexTeamsAPI.webhooks.create() method.

Additional Webex Teams webhook details can be found here:
https://developer.webex.com/webhooks-explained.html

A bot must be created and pointed to this server in the My Apps section of
https://developer.webex.com.  The bot's Access Token should be added as a
'WEBEX_TEAMS_ACCESS_TOKEN' environment variable on the web server hosting this
script.

This script supports Python versions 2 and 3.
